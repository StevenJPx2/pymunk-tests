# pymunk-tests
This is where my Pymunk tests are. Pymunk is a physics engine using chipmunk for python.

I'll come back to this later, when I can understand it a bit better. It's very confusing to me rn.

______

## Some objectives:
- Simulate gravity for my guy, so I wouldn't have to brute-force gravity on him.
- Simulate gravity for the arrow, such that:
  - It will leave the bow converting the potential energy to kinetic, gradually decreasing
  - That results in the arrow having an arc trajectory.

- Simulate the enemy's gravity, similar to the MC.
